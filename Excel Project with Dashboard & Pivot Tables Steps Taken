This project focuses on data cleaning, pivot table creation, and dashboard creation. 

When working with the data we created a working sheet to manipulate and clean the data. 

Data cleaning steps taken: 
  * Check for Duplicates 
  * Replace M with Married, S with Single 
  * Replace F with Female, M with Male 
  * Income changed to currency 
  * Age brackets were created for later visual representation. Created three age brackets- Adolescent, Middle Age, Old

Pivot Tables Built: 
  * Average Income & Bikes Purchased 
  * Commuting Distance 
  * Age Bracket and Bikes Purchased

Dashboard Built with Pivot Table representations and slicers for ease of filtering.
