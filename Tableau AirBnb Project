Dataset Used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset

For this project I created five different visual representations and one dashboard to house each. 

I looked at AirBnb listing inforamtion in Seattle for 2016. I specifically wanted to look at Average Price per Bedroom, Price Per Zipcode, Revenue for the Year, 
and the Count of Bedroom Listings in the data. A graphic was created for each and then placed in a Dashboard for easier viewing. 

The Visuals and Dashboard can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/authoring/SeattleAirBnb2016_17486038371080/Dashboard1#1
