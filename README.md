📊 Data Analyst Portfolio – DataCamp Projects

Welcome! This repository is a showcase of my journey toward becoming a certified Data Analyst through the DataCamp Data Analyst Career Track in collaboration with Alex the Analyst.

Throughout this program, I am developing skills in:

SQL – Data querying, cleaning, and exploration
Excel – Data manipulation, dashboards, and pivot tables
Tableau – Data visualization and storytelling
Power BI – Business intelligence and interactive dashboards

📂 Repository Structure

Each tool I study will have its own directory with project files, datasets (where permitted), and documentation.
